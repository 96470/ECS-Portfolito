<h1>Ceramics</h1>
<p>I am currently interested in ceramics. I am taking a ceramics class and have been realy liking it. 
	It has been fun to try to make small pots.</p>
<h3>How I Started Ceramics</h3>
<p>I took my first ceramics class a few years ago. I saw it as an option for my schedule and thought that it could
be fun. I wrote it down and turned in my schedule. The next year, I got into the class. I wasn't exactly excited
about it. When I had signed up for my schedule, I put another class down. I really wanted to be in this class,
but I didn't get in. I talked to administration, and they helped me get into the class! This was great, but I had to 
drop my ceramics class. I dropped the class and forgot about it. A few years later, I saw a ceramics class on
my schedule sign up sheet. I remembered what had happened with my previous ceramics class and thought about how
I hadn't been able to take it. I really wanted to take the class. I wrote it down and got into the class. </p>
